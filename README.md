## Prerequisites

- Node.js v18+
- A [Neon](https://neon.tech) PostgreSQL database

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Castasebas04/MedAppointments.git
cd MedAppointments/backend
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file inside `backend/`:
DATABASE_URL=your_neon_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
PORT=3000
4. Run database migrations:
```bash
npm run migrate
```

5. Seed initial data (specialties, doctors, schedules):
```bash
npm run seed
```

## Running the app

```bash
npm run dev
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

Open `frontend/index.html` with Live Server or any static file server.
